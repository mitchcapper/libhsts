.TH HSTS "1" "March 2018" "hsts 0.0.1" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsts \- Explore the HSTS Preload data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsts
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fI\,<domains\/\fR...\fI\,>\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
`hsts' explores the HSTS Preload list.  It takes a list of domains on
the command line, or if no domains are present on the command line, it
reads one domain per line from standard input.  It prints its results
to standard output, with each line containing one domain followed by a
colon, followed by the relevant information for that domain.
.SH MODES
The information printed per domain changes based on the selected mode.
.br
Available modes are:
.TP
\fB\-\-is\-public\-suffix\fR
check if domains are public suffixes. [default]
.br
Returned data: 1 if the \fIdomain\fR is a public suffix, 0 otherwise.
.br
This option can be combined with \fB\-\-no\-star\-rule\fR.  It's use will
switch off the PSL 'prevailing star rule' so that all TLDs not
explictly listed in the PSL will return 0 (not a public suffix).
.TP
\fB\-\-is\-cookie\-domain\-acceptable\fR <cookie\-domain>
check if cookie\-domain is acceptable for domains.
.br
Returned data: 1 if \fIcookie-domain\fR is acceptable for the
\fIdomain\fR, 0 otherwise.
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-unreg\-domain\fR
Returned data: the longest public suffix part for each \fIdomain\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-reg\-domain\fR
Returned data: the shortest private suffix part for each \fIdomain\fR.
.SH VERSION INFORMATION
`hsts' can instead be used to report information about the version of
the library and its built-in Public Suffix data:
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show library version information
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-info\fR
print info about library builtin data
.SH PUBLIC SUFFIX DATA
By default, `hsts' will use the latest available Public Suffix data.
.br
You can also direct it to use a different file:
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-latest\-data\fR
use the latest available PSL data [default]
.TP
\fB\-\-use\-builtin\-data\fR
use the builtin PSL data
.TP
\fB\-\-load\-psl\-file\fR <filename>
