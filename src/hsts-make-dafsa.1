hsts-make-dafsa \- generate a compact and optimized DAFSA from a HSTS preload file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsts-make-dafsa
[\fI\,options\/\fR] \fIinfile\fR \fIoutfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhsts-make-dafsa\fR produces C/C++ code or an
architecture-independent binary object that represents a Deterministic
Acyclic Finite State Automaton (DAFSA) from a textual representation
of a Public Suffix List.  Input and output files must be specified on
the command line.

This compact representation enables optimized queries of the list,
saving both time and space when compared to searches of human-readable
representations.
