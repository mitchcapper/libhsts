  `hsts-make-dafsa` - generate a compact and optimized DAFSA from a HSTS preload file

# <a name="Synopsis"/>Synopsis

  `hsts-make-dafsa [options] <infile> <outfile>`

# <a name="Description"/>Description

  `hsts-make-dafsa` produces C/C++ code or an architecture-independent binary object that represents a Deterministic
  Acyclic Finite State Automaton (DAFSA) from a textual representation of a Public Suffix List.
  Input and output files must be specified on the command line.

  This compact representation enables optimized queries of the list, saving
  both time and space when compared to searches of human-readable representations.

  cxx: (default) output is C/C++ code

  cxx+: output is C/C++ code plus statistical assignments (used by libhsts build process)

  binary: output is an architecture-independent binary format

## `--encoding=[utf-8|ascii]`
